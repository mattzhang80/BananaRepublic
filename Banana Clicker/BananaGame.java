        // see cps and banana count. Could Output but already on screen, redundant.
        // Buy minions and see the rate of bps and bananaCounter goes up right.

        // Feature #4
        // to test randomess, use client and see if prints generally random quotes
        // to see array accuracy , for (int i = 0; i < quotes.length; i++)
        //             System.out.println(quotes[i]);
        // at line 79
